            <h2>What exactly is coding? A brief overview:</h2>
            <p>Coding is the process of creating instructions for computers to perform tasks. It has a long and
                fascinating history that spans from the 19th century to the present day. The history of coding begins
                with Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first computer program for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine in 1843.
                She was followed by Alan Turing, who helped break German codes during World War II using Colossus, the
                world’s first programmable, electronic, digital computer, and designed the Automatic Computing Engine
                (ACE), which used a programming language. In the late 1950s, some of the first commercially available
                programming languages emerged, such as <strong>FORTRAN, LISP, and COBOL.</strong> The 1960s brought new
                concepts and
                paradigms to coding, such as structured programming, recursion, and object-oriented programming, with
                languages like <strong>BASIC, ALGOL, Pascal, and C.</strong></p>

            <h2>What exactly is coding? Continued</h2>
            <p>The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of personal computers and graphical user interfaces, which required new
                languages and tools for creating software applications, such as <strong>Logo, Smalltalk, SQL, C++, and
                    Java.</strong> The
                1990s and 2000s witnessed the explosion of the internet and web development, which led to the creation
                of many new languages and frameworks for building websites and web applications, such as <strong>HTML,
                    CSS,
                    JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and C#.</strong> The 2010s and 2020s are witnessing the emergence of
                new trends
                and challenges in coding, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, cloud computing,
                mobile development, blockchain, and cybersecurity. These domains require new languages and tools that
                can handle large amounts of data, complex algorithms, distributed systems, and security issues. Some of
                the languages that are gaining popularity in this era are <strong>R, Swift, Kotlin, Go, Scala, and
                    Rust.</strong>Coding
                is constantly evolving and adapting to new technologies and demands, and it is likely to continue doing
                so in the future.</p>

            <h2>How do I get involved in coding and its community?</h2>
            <p>Here is a simple step-by-step on how you can work your way/get involved in the community!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start with the basics. Learn the fundamentals of coding, such as variables, data types, loops,
                    functions, and logic. You can use online tutorials, courses, books, or videos to learn the basics of
                    coding. You can also try some interactive platforms, such as Codecademy, Khan Academy, or Scratch,
                    that let you learn by doing.</li>
                <li>Choose a coding language. There are many different coding languages, such as Python, Java, C++,
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Each coding language has its own advantages and disadvantages, and
                    some are more suitable for certain tasks than others. You can choose a coding language based on your
                    interests, goals, or preferences. You can also learn multiple coding languages to expand your
                    knowledge and abilities.</li>
                <li>Practice your skills. The best way to improve your coding skills is to practice them regularly. You
                    can use online platforms, such as HackerRank, Codewars, or LeetCode, that offer coding challenges
                    and problems for different levels and topics. You can also work on your own projects, such as
                    creating a website, a game, or an app, that let you apply your skills and creativity.</li>

            <h2>Why is coding so important?</h2>
            <p>One of the most important skills in the modern world is the ability to create instructions for computers
                to perform tasks. This skill, also known as coding or programming, allows us to create software
                applications, websites, games, and other digital products that can solve problems, entertain people, and
                improve lives. With coding, we can turn our ideas into reality and make things that were once impossible
                possible. Coding also helps us develop logical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills that are
                useful in many domains. Whether we want to automate repetitive or tedious tasks, create interactive and
                engaging experiences, analyze and visualize large amounts of information, or innovate and invent new
                technologies, coding can help us achieve our goals. Coding can also help us understand how the world
                works and how we can make it better.

            <h2>When is a good time to code?</h2>
            <p>There is no definitive answer to when you should code, but some possible ideas are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you have a problem that can be solved by coding. For example, if you want to automate a
                    repetitive task, organize your data, or make a personalized tool.</li>
                <li>When you have an idea that can be realized by coding. For example, if you want to create your own
                    website, app, game, or software that does something unique or useful.</li>
                <li>When you want to learn something new or improve your coding skills. For example, if you want to
                    explore a new programming language, framework, or library, or challenge yourself with a coding
                    project or exercise.</li>
                <li>When you enjoy coding and find it rewarding. For example, if you like solving puzzles, making
                    things, or expressing your creativity through code.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Coding can be done at any time and place that suits you, as long as you have access to a computer and the
                internet. You can code alone or with others, online or offline, for fun or for work. The most important
                thing is to code with curiosity and passion.</p>

            <h2>If you find yourself with a lot of free time, and have good amount of experience coding, here is a
                coding project you can do!</h2>
            <p>A simple coding project that someone could do is to create a calculator app. A calculator app is a
                software application that can perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction,
                multiplication, and division. A calculator app can be useful for students, teachers, or anyone who needs
                to do some quick calculations.</p>

            <p>To create a calculator app, you need to use a coding language and a code editor. You can choose any
                coding language that you are familiar with or want to learn, such as Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and more. You can also use any code editor that you prefer or have access to, such as Visual
                Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, and more.</p>

            <p>The steps to create a calculator app are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Design the user interface. The user interface is the part of the app that the user interacts with.
                    You need to design how the app will look and feel, such as the layout, the colors, the fonts, and
                    the buttons. You can use tools such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or Photoshop to design the user
                    interface.</li>
                <li>Write the code. The code is the part of the app that tells the computer what to do. You need to
                    write the code that will make the app work, such as the logic, the functions, and the events. You
                    can use your code editor to write the code and save it in a file or folder.</li>
                <li>Test and debug the app. Testing and debugging are the processes of checking and fixing any errors or
                    bugs in the app. You need to test and debug the app to make sure that it works correctly and
                    smoothly. You can use your code editor or other tools such as PyCharm, Eclipse, Visual Studio, or
                    Chrome DevTools to test and debug the app.</li>
                <li>Run and share the app. Running and sharing are the processes of launching and distributing the app.
                    You need to run and share the app to see how it works and let others use it. You can use your code
                    editor or other tools such as PyInstaller, Electron, Cordova, or Expo to run and share the app.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I have lived in Chapel Hill my entire life until college. I
                currently reside in Charlotte. For as long as I can remember, I have had an interest in problem-solving
                and automation.</p>

            <p><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Prior to Covid 19, I was a bug tester for a startup company
                called Centervention. Other than that I have not had that much work/professional experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Academic Background:</strong> In 2021, I graduated from Chapel Hill high school. I began my
                college career with a major in computer science with the default concentration of Software, Systems, and
                Networks. I am currently in the Software Engineering concentration and I plan on declaring a math minor
                very soon.</p>

            <p><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have been exposed to multiple coding languages throughout
                the years with Java, Python, HTML, and JavaScript being the ones I have more experience with. I have
                done some work in C as well as SQL and am planning on doing a lot more work with them in the future</p>
