            <h3>
                The bad website:
                <a class="weblink" href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/old.htm">
                    The worst website ever!
                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This website was designed in 2008 to be the literal worst website ever created. It was designed to break
                every single design rule as well as make your eyes bleed. Enjoy!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C:</strong>The contrast is extremely poor on this website. Some of the words are near
                    impossible to read because of their multitude of colors. Pretty much none of the fonts are the same
                    either.</li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong>There is just about no repetition on the page. Everything is different than one
                    another and wherever you look their is no common theme at all.</li>
                <li><strong>A:</strong>As far as alignment, there is absolutely none. All the items on the page are not
                    aligned. Some of the boxes overlap making it look even worse.</li>
                <li><strong>P:</strong>The proximity on this page is also really bad. Like I said previously, some of
                    the elements collide with each other and some elements take up way to much room while others
                    obviously need more.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                The good website:
                <a class="weblink" href="https://www.ideo.com/blog">
                    A designer's view of the universe
                </a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This website was created to peer into the mind of a designer and this is reflected as well by how well
                this website is designed. Everything flows really well without it being overwhelming
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C:</strong>This website has some really good contrast. It is very clear what is the most
                    important stuff on the page as more emphasis seems to be placed on said things.</li>
                <li><strong>R:</strong>The repetition on this page is very pleasing to the eye. There are not too many
                    colors on the screen and similar elements use the same design.</li>
                <li><strong>A:</strong>Everything on the page follows some sort of alignment. Elements on the page that
                    provide similar function are aligned the same way. Most importantly not everything is centered in
                    the page.Everything seems to be set in blocks.</li>
                <li><strong>P:</strong>Padding is one of the most important things on a page. Thankfully this page does
                    a really good job at spacing things out along with the padding being repetitive through elements.
