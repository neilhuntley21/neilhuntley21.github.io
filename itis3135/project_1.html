                Dynamic Functionality on the website:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Firstly, all sites are going to have a least a little dynamics to them. All of the headers and footers
                for the files are going to be loaded dynamically. I can simply utilize what I have already done on this
                website to load them again on my final project. On the why page I want to have a slideshow similar to
                the one in <a href="slideshow.html">slideshow</a>. Not only do I already know how to do this, but it
                would give a visual element for people to look at. Giving people more of a connection. I also want to
                add a button system that gives the user a different text depending on their status. For both the what
                and about page, I want to make a simple form like I have been doing all semester. The unique thing that
                I want to add to the form on the "what" page, is that depending on the number that is entered, the total
                count will go up. Lastly, on the form on the "about" page, I want it so that after you send your
                message, it displays it right below on the page.
