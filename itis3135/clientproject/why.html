                    First of all, become a mentor! Being a mentor on a FIRST team is not only rewarding for the
                    students,
                    but also for the mentors themselves. As mentors, they get to share their passion and knowledge with
                    the
                    next generation of innovators and leaders, as well as learn new skills and perspectives from the
                    students and other mentors. They also get to network with other professionals and volunteers in the
                    STEM
                    community, and experience the excitement and satisfaction of seeing the team grow and succeed.
                    Moreover,
                    they get to inspire and be inspired by the team’s creativity, resilience, and teamwork.

                    You might be wondering, what is a mentor? A mentor is any adult who participates in a FIRST team and
                    leads the students by showing them how to do things and guiding them in their area of expertise.
                    They
                    can be involved for as little or as much time as they can, depending on their availability and the
                    team’s needs. They help the team learn how to approach and solve the game challenge by themselves,
                    without providing them with the ready-made solution. They also act as a coach, a teacher, a
                    motivator,
                    and a facilitator for the team, helping them have a fun and enriching experience. They help the team
                    acquire the skills and confidence to pursue their future goals with FIRST. They also benefit from
                    the
                    learning process and share their enthusiasm for making a positive difference in each other’s lives
                    and
                    in the world.

                    Being a mentor on a FIRST team does not require any special skills or qualifications, but it does
                    require patience, dedication, and a willingness to learn alongside the team. In FIRST, mentors and
                    students are equal partners who collaborate and respect each other in working towards a mutual and
                    beneficial goal. This requires a commitment from everyone involved to make the most of the
                    experience.

                    Participating in a FIRST Robotics Competition team is a rewarding and enriching experience for
                    students.
                    It offers them many benefits and opportunities that will help them develop their skills and
                    interests.
                    One of the benefits is working with professional engineers who mentor the students and teach them
                    STEM
                    skills that are essential for their future careers. Another benefit is designing, building, and
                    programming their own robots using advanced software, hardware, and tools that challenge their
                    creativity and problem-solving abilities. A third benefit is improving their teamwork,
                    interpersonal,
                    and communication skills by collaborating with their peers and competing in alliances and
                    tournaments
                    that foster a spirit of sportsmanship and cooperation. A fourth benefit is practicing Gracious
                    Professionalism™, a core value of FIRST that encourages respect and kindness among competitors. They
                    can
                    also qualify for the FIRST Championship, a prestigious event that showcases the best teams from
                    around
                    the world and celebrates their achievements. Finally, a sixth benefit is accessing millions of
                    dollars
                    in college scholarships that are available exclusively for FIRST participants. The impact of FIRST
                    Robotics Competition on students is significant and proven. According to surveys, more than 88% of
                    participants report having more interest in doing well in school and 92% report having more interest
                    in
                    attending college.
