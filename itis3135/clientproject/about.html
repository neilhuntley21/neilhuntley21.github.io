                <p>Our goal is to inspire more young minds to discover their potential in STEM and to reach out to other
                    students. We believe that STEM is not only a field of study, but also a way of thinking and solving
                    problems. We want to share our enthusiasm and knowledge with others and encourage them to pursue
                    their interests and passions. When we are not getting ready for the yearly robotics events hosted by
                    FIRST, we are committed to this mission. We participate in various activities and events that
                    promote STEM education and awareness in our school and community.  
                </p>

                    The CHHS First Robotics Team was started in 2013 by a teacher and former BioMed researcher, Alan
                    Freedman, and 10 students who shared his passion. They faced many challenges and obstacles, such as
                    lack of parent support and organization, but they persevered and learned from their experiences.
                    Now, the team has grown to about 40 students and has separate divisions for each essential function,
                    such as design, programming, marketing, and outreach. The team is guided by Mr. Riley, an Earth
                    Science teacher who used to be a college professor and a carpenter. He brings his expertise and
                    wisdom to the team and helps them achieve their goals. We are committed to the idea that every
                    student has something to offer, and so, we train new members in everything they need to know to be
                    part of the team. Likewise, we never ask for money from our students so that everyone feels included
                    and valued on the team. We are a diverse and inclusive group of students who work together as a team
                    and have fun along the way.
