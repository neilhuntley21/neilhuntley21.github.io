                <p>First robotics competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition that is part of
                    FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a nonprofit organization founded
                    in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen. FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and
                    technology, challenging teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors to build industrial-size
                    robots to play a difficult field game in alliance with other teams. FRC also aims to inspire young
                    people to be leaders and innovators in STEM fields and to address global challenges related to
                    energy and sustainability.</p>
                <p>
                    Each year, FRC teams work during a six-week period to design, program, and build their robots
                    starting with a standard kit of parts and common set of rules. They also have to fundraise to meet
                    their goals, design a team “brand,” and promote STEM in their local community. FRC teams compete for
                    awards that recognize their achievements in various aspects of the competition, such as engineering
                    design, innovation, entrepreneurship, safety, and gracious professionalism.

                    THOR is an acronym for Thundering Herd of Robots, and it is a series of off-season events for
                    FIRST Robotics Competition teams in North Carolina. THOR was started in 2013 by four FRC teams: FRC
                    587 - The Hedgehogs, FRC 2059 - Hitchhikers, FRC 2640 - HotBotz, and FRC 3196 - Team SPORK. Since
                    then, THOR has grown and expanded to include more teams and locations across the state. THOR gives
                    FRC teams an opportunity to play another round of the current game challenge, RAPID REACT, with
                    their robots and compete with other teams in a fun and friendly environment. THOR also helps teams
                    recruit new members, mentors, and sponsors, as well as network with other teams and volunteers in
                    the STEM community. THOR is organized and hosted by FIRST North Carolina and several FRC teams who
                    volunteer their time and resources to make the events possible.
