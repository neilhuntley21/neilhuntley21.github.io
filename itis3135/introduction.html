        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>I have lived in Chapel Hill my entire life until college. I
                currently reside in Charlotte. For as long as I can remember, I have had an interest in problem-solving
                and automation.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong>Prior to Covid 19, I was a bug tester for a startup company
                called Centervention. Other than that I have not had that much work/professional experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>In 2021, I graduated from Chapel Hill high school. I began my
                college career with a major in computer science with the default concentration of Software, Systems, and
                Networks. I am currently in the Software Engineering concentration and I plan on declaring a math minor
                very soon</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>I have been exposed to multiple coding languages throughout
                the years with Java, Python, and C being the ones I have more experience with. I have created really
                basic websites in the past using HTML but have not done much front-end development other than that.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>I mainly use Windows 10. I also occasionally use Linux and
                would to learn about/use it more.</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3155 Software Engineering:</strong> I have been interested in Software Engineering
                        for a while now and am really excited about being able to take the class!</li>
                    <li><strong>LBST 2301 Critical Thinking and Communication:</strong>This course is required for my
                        major</li>
                    <li><strong>ENGL 2116 Introduction to Technical Communication:</strong>This course is required for
                        my major</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 3135 Web-Based Application Design and Development:</strong> I want to learn more
                        HTML as well as front-end development since it will probably be useful to me in the future</li>
                    <li><strong>STAT 2122 Intro to Prob & Stat:</strong>This is a required course for my major and I
                        already have some experience with statistics</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong>I honestly donâ€™t think that I have tried a
                single bowl of cereal in my entire life! People are usually absolutely shocked when I tell them this.
            </li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong>I am incredibly interested in sim-racing and love racing in
                virtual reality!</li>
